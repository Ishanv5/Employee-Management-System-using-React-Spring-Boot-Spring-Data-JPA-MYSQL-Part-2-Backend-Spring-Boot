This project implements a full-stack Employee Management System using React for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend API, Spring Data JPA for data persistence with MySQL, and enables CRUD operations for employee data.
Technologies Used

    Frontend: React
    Backend: Spring Boot
    Data Persistence: Spring Data JPA
    Database: MySQL
    Operations: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Getting Started

Prerequisites:

    Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed (https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)
    Java 11 or higher installed (https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp)
    MySQL database server running (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

Backend Setup:

    Clone this repository.
    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    Install backend dependencies:

Bash

mvn install

Use code with caution.

    Configure the database connection details in src/main/resources/application.properties. Update the following properties:

Properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password

Use code with caution.

    Run the backend server:

Bash

mvn spring-boot:run

Use code with caution.

Frontend Setup:

    Navigate to the frontend directory.
    Install frontend dependencies:

Bash

npm install

Use code with caution.

    Start the development server:

Bash

npm start

Use code with caution.

This will start the React development server at http://localhost:3000 by default. The backend API should be running at http://localhost:8080 by default (port might vary).
Usage

The React application will provide a user interface for managing employees. You can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee data.
Additional Notes

    This is a basic implementation and can be extended with additional features like user authentication, role-based access control, etc.
    Refer to the official documentation for React, Spring Boot, and Spring Data JPA for further details.
